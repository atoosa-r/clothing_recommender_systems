# Streamlit Demo for Clothing Recommender Systems

This Streamlit Demo application is designed to showcase the functionality of different recommender systems developed as part of the "Enhancing Clothing Recommendations through Data-Driven Recommender Systems" project. The primary focus of this demo is to provide an interactive user experience for a BERT-based or language-based recommender system.

## Purpose

The purpose of this Streamlit application is to:

- Demonstrate how the BERT-based recommender system works.
- Allow new customers to input a sentence that acts as their 'purchase history.'
- Provide personalized clothing recommendations based on the input sentence.

This application serves as a small portion of the larger project, illustrating the practical implementation and effectiveness of the developed models.

## Associated Files

The Streamlit demo relies on the following files, which are all available in this [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1wjLAelGkrZarN97FisOU3Kt5l-8QuFM7):

- `BERT_model/` (folder containing the BERT model)
- `article_embeddings.npy`: Contains the embeddings of the articles used for recommendations.
- `article_ids.npy`: Stores the IDs of the articles.
- `filtered_articles.pkl`: A pickle file containing filtered articles information.

Feel free to explore the repository and experiment with the application to understand the capabilities of the recommender systems better.
