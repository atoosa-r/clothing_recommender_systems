Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA conducted in this project revealed significant insights and trends within the dataset, laying a solid foundation for further analysis and model development. Key findings include:
•	Categorical Data Trends: Major trends based on color, garment groups, departments, and product types.
•	Redundant Columns: Identification of redundant columns that will be dropped in subsequent analyses to streamline the process.
•	Null Values: Handling of null values to ensure data quality and integrity.
•	Data Size Reduction: Strategies for reducing the size of the transactions dataset for more efficient processing.

Future Work

Moving forward, the project will focus on:
•	Modeling and Predictive Analytics: Developing and evaluating various models to improve product recommendations.
•	Implementation: Integrating the recommendation system into a user-friendly application.
•	Continuous Improvement: Iteratively refining the models and recommendations based on user feedback and additional data.
