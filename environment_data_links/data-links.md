## Data Links

Below is a Google Drive link to the original and cleaned CSV files, as well as a folder containing all images associated with the corresponding article_id.  The images are categorized into folders based on the first three digits of the article_id. Each image is named the same as its article_id number but with an additional 0 at the beginning. For example, the image for article_id `790006001` is named `0790006001` and is located in the `079` folder. The images have been resized to about 40% of their original size for computational efficiency. These files are utilized throughout this project.
