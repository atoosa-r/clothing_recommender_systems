    "\n",
    "In this data analysis, we explore H&M Group datasets, including transactions, customer information, and article details. H&M Group operates globally with 53 online markets and approximately 4850 stores. The objective is to uncover insights for developing effective product recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will develop a recommender system based on word embeddings. We will utilize BERT from the Sentence Transformers library to generate embeddings for product descriptions. Additionally, we will enhance these descriptions by incorporating the `colour_group_name` column, providing more context and detail to improve the recommendation accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Plan**\n",
    "1. Data Preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Merge the `colour_group_name` column with the `detail_desc` column to create more refined product descriptions.\n",
    "- Ensure data consistency and handle any missing values that may already be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Word Embedding with BERT:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a Sentence Transformer model to generate embeddings for the updated product descriptions.\n",
    "- Prepare the embeddings for use in the recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Building the Recommendation System:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Develop a recommendation system based on the generated embeddings.\n",
    "- Evaluate and fine-tune the system for optimal performance.\n",
